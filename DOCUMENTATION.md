# First Web Application
The first application that every programmer write is a 'Hello World' program. That means that when you start the program or the web server you see 'Hello World'
on the screen. First you need to type ```furt create-app <name>``` into your cli. With this command you can create the base structur of a furt app. Next type 
```furt generate --component <name>```. That makes you your own furt component, in this component we write your code.
